# CORE PRINCIPLES (ALWAYS RETAIN)
- "Don't Type, Tap" philosophy: 90% of user interactions require no typing
- Quota Zero Impact: All debugging must consume zero Google Cloud quota
- Partitioning is Non-Negotiable: Every major table must be partitioned
- Cluster for Performance: Use clustering on commonly filtered columns
- Use Appropriate Data Types: INT64, BOOL, DATE instead of STRING
- Nest and Repeat for Efficiency: Denormalize with REPEATED fields
- Never query raw_events or journal tables in user-facing requests
- Check the master_cache first for pre-computed results
- Use BQML for prediction instead of complex business logic
- LOOP PREVENTION: Never reprocess previously completed work
