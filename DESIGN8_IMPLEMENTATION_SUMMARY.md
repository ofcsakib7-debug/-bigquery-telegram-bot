# Design 8 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Design 8: Multi-Input Command System with Contextual Navigation Prompt for Qwen Coder. The implementation includes all requirements specified in the design document.

## New Files Created

### BigQuery Schemas

  - `COMMAND_PATTERNS_SCHEMA`
  - `PRELISTED_ITEMS_SCHEMA`
  - `CONTEXTUAL_ACTIONS_SCHEMA`
  - `ADMIN_MANAGEMENT_SCHEMA`
  - `BQML_TRAINING_CONTEXTUAL_ACTIONS_SCHEMA`

### BigQuery Modules
- `bigquery/bqml_training.js` - BQML training data infrastructure
- `bigquery/quota_saving.js` - Quota-saving implementation with optimized queries
- `bigquery/scheduled_queries.js` - Scheduled query definitions for daily operations

### Function Modules
- `functions/multi_input_processor.js` - Core multi-input command processing engine
- `functions/contextual_actions.js` - Contextual action suggestion engine with inline keyboard formatting
- `functions/admin_management.js` - Admin management system with privilege checking
- `functions/department_validations.js` - Department-specific validation logic

### Documentation
- `design8_README.md` - Comprehensive documentation of the Design 8 implementation
- `verify_design8.js` - Verification script to ensure all requirements are met

## Updates to Existing Files

### Processor Module
- `functions/processor.js` - Integrated multi-input command processing and admin command handling

### Callbacks Module
- `functions/callbacks.js` - Added admin callback handling

### Commands Module
- `functions/commands.js` - Added admin command handling

## Key Features Implemented

### Multi-Input Command Processing Engine
- Processes space-separated segments as independent inputs
- Completes primary processing within 500ms for user-facing responses
- Implements department-specific parsing rules
- Processes maximum 5 segments per message
- Returns immediate acknowledgment with processing message
- Presents all suggestions as tappable inline keyboard options
- Uses two-phase processing (immediate results + background alternatives)

### Department-Specific Validation
- INVENTORY: Multi-model quantity search patterns (a2b=2)
- FINANCE: Payment amount patterns (p=5000)
- SERVICE: Ticket reference patterns (t=123)
- ADMIN: Department management patterns (adddept=HR)
- SALES: Customer and pricing patterns (cust=ABC, price=250)
- HR: Staff and attendance patterns (staff=123, att=PRESENT)
- MANAGEMENT: Reporting patterns (rpt=sales, period=cm)

### Contextual Action Suggestion Engine
- Presents all suggestions as tappable inline keyboard options
- Follows Telegram inline keyboard format (max 2 buttons per row)
- Uses callback data format: `ctx:{action_id}:{context_data}`
- Includes 2-4 actionable suggestions per response
- Sorts suggestions by confidence_score (highest first)
- Always includes "?? Back to Main Menu" option
- Includes snooze options for non-urgent actions

### Admin Management System
- Verifies user has admin privileges before processing
- Requires confirmation for destructive actions (delete)
- Provides tappable suggestions for similar items
- Includes audit trail for all admin actions
- Implements department-specific validation rules

### BQML Training Infrastructure
- Daily scheduled query for bqml_training_contextual_actions at 02:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for contextual_action_model retraining at 03:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Uses boosted tree classifier for pattern recognition
- Includes department_id as a categorical feature
- Includes hour_of_day and day_of_week as features
- Includes user_role as a feature
- Uses only data from the last 90 days
- Validates model performance before deployment

### Quota-Saving Implementation
- NEVER queries raw command_patterns or contextual_actions in user-facing requests
- ALWAYS filters by partitioning column first in all queries
- ALWAYS includes at least one clustering column in WHERE clause
- Uses approximate functions (APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT) where exact counts aren't needed
- For large aggregations, always uses approximate quantiles (APPROX_QUANTILES)
- NEVER uses SELECT * - always specifies exact columns needed
- Layer 1 (Syntax Validation): Completes within 5ms, zero BigQuery quota
- Layer 2 (Logical Validation): Completes within 10ms, zero BigQuery quota
- Layer 3 (BQML Anomaly Detection): Completes within 200ms, uses pre-aggregated tables

### Data Expiration Policies
- command_patterns: 36 months
- prelisted_items: 24 months
- contextual_actions: 12 months
- bqml_training_contextual_actions: 90 days

## Verification
All Design 8 requirements have been verified and implemented successfully. The system is ready for use.
