# Design 7, Phase 1 Implementation Summary

This document confirms the complete implementation of the foundational database architecture for the 4-layer logical error detection system as specified in the design7_phase1.txt file.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Logical Error Patterns Table
- Created `logical_error_patterns.sql` with exact schema requirements
- Includes all required fields with proper data types
- Implements partitioning by `DATE(created_at)`
- Implements clustering by `department_id, error_type, severity_level`
- Sets data expiration to 36 months

### 2. Error Detection Events Table
- Created `error_detection_events.sql` with exact schema requirements
- Includes all required fields with proper data types
- Implements partitioning by `DATE(timestamp)`
- Implements clustering by `department_id, error_type, detection_layer`
- Sets data expiration to 12 months

### 3. BQML Training Data Infrastructure
- Created `bqml_training_error_detection.sql` with exact schema requirements
- Includes all required fields with proper data types
- Implements partitioning by `training_date`
- Implements clustering by `department_id, error_type, detection_layer`
- Sets data expiration to 90 days

### 4. Error Pattern Recognition Model
- Created `error_pattern_model.sql` with exact implementation requirements
- Uses boosted tree classifier as specified
- Includes proper data selection with 180-day limit
- Implements daily training schedule

### 5. Department-Specific Error Cache Tables
- Created `department_error_cache_template.sql` as a template for all departments
- Template includes proper schema with all required fields
- Implements partitioning by `DATE(expires_at)`
- Implements clustering by `user_id, transaction_type`

### 6. Scheduled Reconciliation Table
- Created `logical_errors_daily.sql` with exact schema requirements
- Includes all required fields with proper data types
- Implements partitioning by `detection_date`
- Implements clustering by `error_type, confidence_score`
- Sets data expiration to 90 days

### 7. Scheduled Queries
- Created `scheduled_training_data.sql` for daily training data updates at 02:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Created `scheduled_model_retraining.sql` for daily model retraining at 03:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Created `scheduled_errors_reconciliation.sql` for daily errors reconciliation at 04:00 Asia/Dhaka
- All scheduled queries include proper labels and quota monitoring

### 8. Department-Specific Implementations
- Created `department_error_patterns.sql` with patterns for all 7 departments
- Created `department_bqml_models.sql` with models for all departments
- Includes all department-specific error patterns as specified:
  - FINANCE: Payment date before transaction date
  - INVENTORY: Delivery date before manufacturing date
  - SALES: Sale date before customer creation date
  - SERVICE: Service date before delivery date
  - MARKETING: Campaign start date after interaction date
  - HR: Leave start date before attendance date
  - MANAGEMENT: Budget allocation date before fiscal year start

### 9. Documentation
- Created `README.md` documenting the implementation
- Created `init_logical_error_detection.sql` as a complete initialization script

## Compliance with Requirements

All requirements from Design 7, Phase 1 have been implemented exactly as specified:

1. ✅ All table schemas match exactly
2. ✅ All partitioning and clustering strategies implemented
3. ✅ All data expiration policies set
4. ✅ All scheduled queries created with proper timing and labels
5. ✅ Department-specific error patterns defined
6. ✅ Department-specific BQML models created
7. ✅ Quota-saving implementation rules followed
8. ✅ Layered validation rules implemented
9. ✅ Data validation requirements implemented

This implementation provides the complete foundation for the 4-layer logical error detection system while operating within Google Cloud free tier limits.
