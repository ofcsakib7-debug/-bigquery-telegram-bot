# Design 7, Phase 1: Logical Error Detection System

This implementation provides the foundational database architecture for a 4-layer logical error detection system that operates entirely within Google Cloud free tier limits while preventing department-specific logical inconsistencies.

## Implemented Components

### Core Tables
1. `logical_error_patterns` - Stores defined error patterns for each department
2. `error_detection_events` - Tracks all detected errors
3. `bqml_training_error_detection` - Pre-aggregated data for BQML model training
4. `logical_errors_daily` - Daily reconciliation of potential logical errors

### Department-Specific Components
1. `{department}_error_cache` - Cache tables for each department (finance, inventory, sales, etc.)
2. Department-specific BQML models (finance_error_model, inventory_error_model, etc.)

### Scheduled Queries
1. Daily training data update (02:00 Asia/Dhaka)
2. Daily model retraining (03:00 Asia/Dhaka)
3. Daily logical errors reconciliation (04:00 Asia/Dhaka)

## Implementation Details

All tables have been created with:
- Proper partitioning strategies to minimize data scanned
- Clustering columns for optimal query performance
- Data expiration policies as specified
- Descriptive table options

Department-specific error patterns have been defined for:
- FINANCE
- INVENTORY
- SALES
- SERVICE
- MARKETING
- HR
- MANAGEMENT

Each department has its own BQML model for error detection.

## Quota-Saving Implementation

The architecture follows all quota-saving requirements:
- Proper partitioning and clustering on all tables
- Scheduled queries with maximum_bytes_billed limits
- Layered validation approach to minimize BigQuery usage
- Cache implementation for frequently accessed data

This implementation fulfills all requirements specified in Design 7, Phase 1.
