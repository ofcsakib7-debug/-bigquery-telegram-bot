# Design 10 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Design 10: BQML-Powered Due List Management System for Qwen Coder. The implementation includes all requirements specified in the design document.

## New Files Created

### BigQuery Schemas
- `bigquery/design10_schemas.js` - Contains all table schemas as specified:
  - `DUE_ITEMS_SCHEMA`
  - `DUE_PAYMENT_JOURNAL_SCHEMA`
  - `DUE_PAYMENT_CACHE_SCHEMA`
  - `USER_FORGETFULNESS_PROFILES_SCHEMA`
  - `CRM_CUSTOMER_LEDGER_SCHEMA`
  - `BQML_TRAINING_CUSTOMER_PAYMENTS_SCHEMA`

### BigQuery Modules
- `bigquery/quota_saving_design10.js` - Quota-saving implementation with optimized queries for Design 10
- `bigquery/bqml_customer_payments.js` - BQML training data infrastructure for customer payments

### Function Modules
- `functions/due_items.js` - Due items management system
- `functions/customer_payments.js` - Customer payment management system
- `functions/department_due_items.js` - Department-specific due items implementation

### Documentation and Verification
- `verify_design10.js` - Verification script to ensure all requirements are met

## Key Features Implemented

### The "Due Item" Entity
- Table: `due_items` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for due_id (DUE-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Status validation (PENDING, PARTIAL, COMPLETED, OVERDUE)
- Priority level calculation using BQML
- Data expiration: 36 months after due_date
- Partitioning on due_date with clustering by entity_type, status, priority_level

### Dual-Layer Due Tracking System
- Journal Table: `due_payment_journal` (append-only, immutable record)
- Cache Table: `due_payment_cache` (materialized view for fast queries)
- ALL user-facing queries read from cache table only
- Automatic cache refresh scheduled at 2AM-4AM Bangladesh time
- Data expiration: 7 days for cache table

### Snooze Intelligence System
- Table: `user_forgetfulness_profiles` with exact schema specifications
- Personalized snooze options based on user profiles
- Format validation for profile_id (PROF-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Data expiration: 12 months after snapshot_date
- Tappable inline keyboard buttons for snooze options
- Callback data format: snooze:{duration}:{due_id}

### Customer Payment Management System
- Table: `crm_customer_ledger` with exact schema specifications
- Customer reliability scoring (0-100 scale)
- On-time payment rate tracking (0-100 percentage)
- Data expiration: 24 months after last_updated
- Daily scheduled updates via scheduled query

### BQML Training Data Infrastructure
- Table: `bqml_training_customer_payments` with exact schema specifications
- Daily data aggregation from payment receipts
- Feature calculation for machine learning models
- Data expiration: 90 days after training_date
- Logistic regression for binary classification
- Daily model retraining during off-peak hours

### Quota-Saving Implementation
- NEVER query raw due_items or due_payment_journal in user-facing requests
- ALWAYS filter by partitioning column first in all queries
- ALWAYS include at least one clustering column in WHERE clause
- Use approximate functions (APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT) where exact counts aren't needed
- For large aggregations, always use approximate quantiles (APPROX_QUANTILES)
- NEVER use SELECT * - always specify exact columns needed
- ALWAYS use --maximum_bytes_billed flag for all user-facing queries

### Layered Validation Rules
1. Layer 1 (Application Logic): Complete within 50ms, zero BigQuery quota
2. Layer 2 (Contextual Validation): Complete within 100ms, Firestore reads only
3. Layer 3 (BQML Anomaly Detection): Complete within 200ms, cached data first
4. Layer 4 (Scheduled Reconciliation): Off-peak hours, previous day's data only

### Scheduled Query Requirements
- Daily scheduled query for due_payment_cache refresh at 02:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for crm_customer_ledger refresh at 02:30 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for bqml_training_customer_payments at 03:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for customer_payment_model retraining at 04:00 Asia/Dhaka

### Data Validation Requirements
- CHECK constraints for all critical fields
- Format validation for due_id, journal_id, profile_id
- Value validation for status, transaction_type, recurring_frequency
- Range validation for customer_reliability_score, on_time_payment_rate
- Automatic data quality checks as scheduled queries

### Data Expiration Policies
- due_items: 36 months
- due_payment_journal: 36 months
- due_payment_cache: 7 days
- crm_customer_ledger: 24 months
- user_forgetfulness_profiles: 12 months
- bqml_training_customer_payments: 90 days

### Department-Specific Implementation
- INVENTORY: Link due items to machine sales
- FINANCE: Integrate with accounting_general_ledger
- INTERNAL: Include utility and operational payments
- SALES: Prioritize high-value customer payments
- FINANCE: Prioritize overdue internal payments
- Role-Based Views:
  - STAFF: Show assigned due items only
  - MANAGER: Show team due items with performance metrics
  - ADMIN: Show company-wide due items with reliability analysis

## Verification
All Design 10 requirements have been verified and implemented successfully. The system is ready for use.
