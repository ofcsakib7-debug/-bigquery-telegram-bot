# Immediate Memory Purge System Implementation

## Immediate Memory Purge Implementation Requirements:
• Purge must trigger immediately after each completed development segment
• Purge must identify specific items to delete (never entire context)
• Purge must verify items are no longer relevant to current task
• Purge must log all deleted items for potential recovery
• Purge must never delete Core Principles or current Active Context
• Purge must never exceed 50 tokens of processing

## Memory Purge Functions:

```python
def apply_immediate_memory_purge():
    """Immediately delete old unrelated documentation/memory"""
    # 1. Identify old context (anything not related to current task)
    old_context = identify_old_context()
    
    # 2. Immediately delete old context (no delay)
    delete_old_context(old_context)
    
    # 3. Verify memory usage is within limits
    verify_memory_usage()
    
    # 4. Check for looping behavior
    loop_detection = detect_looping_behavior()
    if loop_detection['loop_detected']:
        handle_looping_behavior(loop_detection)
    
    # 5. Log purged items
    log_purged_items(old_context)

def identify_old_context():
    """Identify old context not related to current task"""
    # Implementation details for identifying old context
    pass

def delete_old_context(old_context):
    """Delete old context"""
    # Implementation details for deleting old context
    pass

def verify_memory_usage():
    """Verify memory usage is within limits"""
    # Implementation details for verifying memory usage
    pass

def log_purged_items(purged_items):
    """Log purged items for potential recovery"""
    # Implementation details for logging purged items
    pass
```

## Progressive Forgetting Protocol:

```python
def apply_progressive_forgetting():
    """Apply progressive forgetting after each completed component"""
    # After each completed component
    if component_completed:
        # 1. Summarize accomplishments (retain 50 tokens)
        create_implementation_summary()
        
        # 2. Immediately discard implementation details (save 150+ tokens)
        discard_implementation_details()
        
        # 3. Keep only interfaces and architectural decisions (retain 100 tokens)
        preserve_interfaces_and_decisions()
        
        # 4. Update context summary with only essential information
        update_context_summary()
        
        # 5. Immediately purge any remaining unrelated memory
        apply_immediate_memory_purge()
        
        # 6. Check for and prevent looping
        check_loop_prevention()
```
