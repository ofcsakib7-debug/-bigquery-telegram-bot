RESUME DEVELOPMENT FROM THIS POINT

You are continuing development of the Google Cloud architecture for a Telegram bot interface for business operations in Bangladesh.

Last completed component: system_initialization
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Last modified: 2025-08-24 12:15 UTC

CURRENT TASK: Implement environment variable validation in initialization script

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Telegram bot must respond within 1 second with "Processing..." message
- All processing happens asynchronously via Pub/Sub
- Implement micro-batching for BigQuery writes (max 100 records per insert)
- System must operate entirely within Google Cloud free tier limits

DATA SOURCES:
- Firestore for user state management and session tracking
- BigQuery for data storage with partitioning and clustering
- Pub/Sub for message queuing between webhook and processing functions

NEXT IMPLEMENTATION STEP:
Complete the initialization script with proper environment variable validation and implement the Pub/Sub and Firestore initialization functions.

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- JavaScript functions with proper error handling
- Detailed console logging for debugging
- Clear separation of concerns between different initialization tasks
- Proper async/await patterns for Google Cloud services
