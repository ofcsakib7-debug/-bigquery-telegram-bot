## Core Components

### 1. Search Intent Engine
The core of the system interprets user input and maps it to appropriate queries based on learned patterns.

**Key Functions:**
- `interpretSearchInput()`: Converts abbreviated input to full queries
- `getSearchIntentPrediction()`: Uses BQML to predict search success
- `generateSearchAlternatives()`: Provides alternative interpretations

### 2. Pattern Management
Manages the database of known search patterns and their mappings.

**Key Functions:**
- `discoverNewPatterns()`: Finds frequently used patterns not in the database
- `validateNewPatterns()`: Ensures discovered patterns meet quality criteria
- `updatePatternWeights()`: Adjusts pattern priority based on performance

### 3. Cache System
Optimizes performance by caching frequently accessed results.

**Key Functions:**
- `getFromSearchCache()`: Retrieves cached results
- `storeInSearchCache()`: Stores computed results for future use
- `implementAdaptiveCaching()`: Adjusts cache TTL based on usage patterns

### 4. Analytics Engine
Provides insights into system performance and user behavior.

**Key Functions:**
- `generateSearchAnalyticsDashboard()`: Creates comprehensive analytics reports
- `collectPerformanceMetrics()`: Monitors system responsiveness
- `detectAnomalies()`: Identifies unusual patterns in system behavior

## Search Implementation

### Search Intent Processing

The search intent processing system converts abbreviated user input into meaningful queries:

```
User Input: "t bnk p cm"
Interpreted Query: "total bank payments current month"
Query Type: PAYMENT
Confidence Score: 0.95
```

### Pattern Matching

The system uses a combination of exact matching and BQML-powered prediction:

1. **Exact Pattern Matching**: First checks for exact matches in the pattern database
2. **BQML Prediction**: Uses machine learning to predict intent for novel patterns
3. **Contextual Refinement**: Adjusts predictions based on user context

### Department-Specific Patterns

Each department has its own set of patterns optimized for their workflows:

#### Accounting Department
- "t bnk p cm" → Total bank payments current month
- "exp sum lw" → Expense summary last week
- "cash rcpts td" → Cash receipts today

#### Sales Department
- "dlv chln pend" → Delivery challans pending
- "cust pay tw" → Customer payments this week
- "stk lvl cat" → Stock levels by category

#### Inventory Department
- "mach mdl stk" → Machine models in stock
- "low qty alrt" → Low quantity alerts
- "prt avl srch" → Part availability search

#### Service Department
- "open srv tkt" → Open service tickets
- "tech sched" → Technician schedules
- "mnt due soon" → Maintenance due soon

#### Marketing Department
- "cust acq rate" → Customer acquisition rate
- "fact vst sch" → Factory visit schedule
- "lead conv stat" → Lead conversion stats

## Validation & Auto-Correction

### Layered Validation System

The system implements a four-layer validation funnel:

1. **Syntax Validation**: Basic character and format validation (0 quota cost)
2. **Logical Validation**: Department-specific pattern validation (0 quota cost)
3. **Heuristic Pattern Check**: BQML-powered pattern analysis (0 quota cost with caching)
4. **Semantic Validation**: Context-aware validation for suspicious queries

### Multi-Layer Validation Process

#### Layer 1: Syntax Validation
- Character set validation (only lowercase letters, numbers, spaces, and {variables})
- Length constraints (2-20 characters)
- Variable format checking ({name} where name is alphanumeric)
- Consecutive space detection
- Leading/trailing space detection

#### Layer 2: Logical Validation
- Department-specific pattern matching
- Variable constraint validation (time periods, amounts, dates, quantities)
- User context verification
- Pattern similarity analysis for suggestions

#### Layer 3: Heuristic Pattern Check
- BQML-powered suspicion scoring
- User behavior analysis
- Context-aware pattern evaluation
- Cached predictions for performance

#### Layer 4: Semantic Validation
- Applied only for suspicious queries
- Typo detection using Levenshtein distance
- Confidence scoring for corrections
- Alternative suggestion generation

### Auto-Correction

The auto-correction system provides intelligent suggestions for typos:

```
User Input: "t bnk py cm" (typo: "py" instead of "p")
Suggestion: Did you mean "t bnk p cm"? 
```

### Typo Correction Training

The system uses BQML to train typo correction models:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers correction examples from user interactions
2. **Model Training**: Trains k-means clustering models on correction patterns
3. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates model accuracy with Davies-Bouldin index
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly retrains models with fresh data

### Common Corrections Cache

The system maintains a cache of frequently used corrections:

- **Department-Specific**: Corrections tailored to each department
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each correction has a confidence score
- **Usage Tracking**: Tracks how often corrections are used
- **Automatic Updates**: Regularly updates based on user interactions

### Validation Performance

The validation system meets strict performance requirements:

- **Layer 1**: <5ms with 100% accuracy
- **Layer 2**: <10ms with 95% accuracy
- **Layer 3**: <50ms with 85% accuracy
- **Total Validation**: <100ms per request
- **Cache Hit Rate**: 95% for typo corrections from common_corrections cache

## Context-Aware Features

### Time-Based Context

The system adapts to time of day:

- **Morning (6-11am)**: Suggests "Finish coffee first" snooze options
- **Afternoon (12-5pm)**: Suggests "After lunch break" snooze options
- **Evening (5pm+)**: Suggests "Tomorrow morning" snooze options

### User History Context

Patterns are personalized based on user behavior:

## Multi-Model Quantity Search

### Syntax

Multi-model quantity search uses the format:
```
{model_code}={quantity} {model_code}={quantity} ...
```

Examples:
- "a2b=2 e4s=3" → 2 Juki A2B machines and 3 Brother E4S machines
- "t5c=1 j3h=2 cm" → 1 Toyota T5C and 2 Jack J3H with current month pricing

### Features
