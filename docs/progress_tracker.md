## Last Completed Work
Implemented core Telegram bot structure with webhook verification and Pub/Sub integration. Created basic message processing functions with command and callback handling.

Implemented department-specific workflows. Added BQML integration for UI optimization. Implemented security features including KMS encryption. Implemented error handling and retry logic with circuit breaker pattern.

## Next Steps
1. Implement Cloud Scheduler jobs for daily/weekly/monthly tasks
2. Add comprehensive testing suite
3. Implement monitoring and alerting
4. Add documentation and deployment guides
5. Perform load testing and optimization

## Critical Context for Resumption
- Telegram bot must respond within 1 second with "Processing..." message
- All processing happens asynchronously via Pub/Sub
- Must implement micro-batching for BigQuery writes (max 100 records per insert)
- System must operate entirely within Google Cloud free tier limits
- "Don't Type, Tap" philosophy - all user interactions via predefined buttons
