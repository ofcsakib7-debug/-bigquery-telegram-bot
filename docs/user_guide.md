# BigQuery Telegram Bot System - User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the BigQuery Telegram Bot System! This comprehensive business management system is designed specifically for operations in Bangladesh, providing an intuitive interface through Telegram while operating entirely within Google Cloud free tier limits.

The system follows the "Don't Type, Tap" philosophy, meaning all interactions happen through predefined buttons rather than free-form text input. This approach eliminates approximately 90% of validation needs and provides a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Accessing the Bot

1. Open Telegram on your device
2. Search for your organization's bot (e.g., @YourCompanyFinanceBot)
3. Click "Start" or send `/start` to begin

### 2. First-Time Setup

Upon first interaction, the bot will:
- Welcome you by name
- Display department-specific options based on your profile
- Show any pending notifications

### 3. Navigation

The bot uses a consistent navigation pattern:
- **Main Menu**: Accessible via `/start` or dedicated buttons
- **Department Options**: Specific to your role and department
- **Snooze Options**: Available at the bottom of every screen
- **Back Navigation**: Use "Back to Main Menu" or "Back" buttons
