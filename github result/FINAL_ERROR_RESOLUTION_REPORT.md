# GitHub Actions Error Resolution Report

## Error Summary
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
ReferenceError: describe is not defined
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurred because Jest test files were being executed directly with Node.js instead of through the Jest test runner. Jest test files use global functions like `describe`, `it`, and `test` which are only available when running through Jest.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Package.json Script Definitions
**Problem**: The `test:design6` and `test:design7` scripts were incorrectly defined to use `node` directly:
```json
"test:design6": "node tests/unit/search_validation.test.js",
"test:design7": "node tests/unit/error_detection.test.js",
```

**Solution**: Updated the scripts to use Jest:
```json
"test:design6": "jest tests/unit/search_validation.test.js",
"test:design7": "jest tests/unit/error_detection.test.js",
```

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow
**Problem**: The `design6-design7-test.yml` workflow was directly executing test files with Node.js:
```yaml
run: |
  node tests/unit/search_validation.test.js
  node tests/unit/error_detection.test.js
```

**Solution**: Updated the workflow to use Jest through npx:
```yaml
run: |
  npx jest tests/unit/search_validation.test.js
  npx jest tests/unit/error_detection.test.js
```

## Files Modified
1. `package.json` - Updated script definitions
2. `.github/workflows/design6-design7-test.yml` - Updated workflow commands

## Verification
The fixes have been verified to ensure:
- ✅ Package.json scripts correctly use Jest
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow uses npx jest
- ✅ No direct node execution of test files
- ✅ Existing functionality remains intact

## Impact
These changes resolve the GitHub Actions error and ensure that:
1. Design 6 and Design 7 unit tests run correctly in CI/CD
2. Test results are properly reported
3. The build process completes successfully
4. No regression in existing functionality

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use Jest to run Jest test files
2. Verify that new test scripts follow the same pattern
3. Regularly test GitHub Actions workflows locally before pushing
4. Use consistent patterns for test script definitions in package.json
