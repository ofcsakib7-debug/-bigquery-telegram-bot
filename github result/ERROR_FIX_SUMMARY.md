# Error Report Analysis and Fixes

## Issue Identified
The error report from GitHub Actions shows:
```
ReferenceError: describe is not defined
```

This error occurs because Jest test files (which use `describe`, `it`, `test` functions) were being run directly with Node.js instead of through the Jest test runner.

## Root Cause
1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: The `design6-design7-test.yml` workflow was running test files directly with `node` command
2. **Package.json Scripts**: The `test:design6` and `test:design7` scripts were using `node` instead of `jest`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed GitHub Actions Workflow (design6-design7-test.yml)
**Before:**
```bash
node tests/unit/search_validation.test.js
node tests/unit/error_detection.test.js
```

**After:**
```bash
npx jest tests/unit/search_validation.test.js
npx jest tests/unit/error_detection.test.js
```

### 2. Fixed Package.json Scripts
**Before:**
```json
"test:design6": "node tests/unit/search_validation.test.js",
"test:design7": "node tests/unit/error_detection.test.js",
```

**After:**
```json
"test:design6": "jest tests/unit/search_validation.test.js",
"test:design7": "jest tests/unit/error_detection.test.js",
```

## Verification
After these fixes, the Jest test files will be properly executed by the Jest test runner, which recognizes the `describe`, `it`, and `test` functions, resolving the "ReferenceError: describe is not defined" error.

## Additional Notes
- The existing `test:unit` and `test:integration` scripts were already correctly using Jest
- The `test:design6-design7` script correctly uses Node.js because it runs a standalone test script, not Jest test files
- All other workflows that use npm scripts will now work correctly with the fixed package.json
