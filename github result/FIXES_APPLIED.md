# GitHub Result Directory Fixes

## Issue Summary
The test files in the `github result/tests/unit/` directory were using incorrect relative paths to import modules from the functions directory.

## Root Cause
From `github result/tests/unit/`, the path `../../functions/search_validation` was resolving to `github result/functions/search_validation`, but the functions directory is actually at the root level of the project.

## Fix Applied
Updated the import paths in both test files:

### Before (incorrect):
```javascript
const { validate_search_query, validate_syntax, validate_logic, check_heuristic_patterns } = require('../../functions/search_validation');
```

### After (correct):
```javascript
const { validate_search_query, validate_syntax, validate_logic, check_heuristic_patterns } = require('../../../functions/search_validation');
```

## Files Modified
1. `github result/tests/unit/search_validation.test.js` - Fixed import path
2. `github result/tests/unit/error_detection.test.js` - Fixed import path

## Verification
The paths are now correctly pointing to the functions directory:
- From `github result/tests/unit/`
- `../../../` goes up 3 levels to reach the root directory
- `/functions/search_validation` reaches the target module

This fix resolves the "Cannot find module" error that was occurring when running the tests.
