## Key Features Implemented

- Data expiration: 24 months after effective_to
- Partitioning on effective_from with clustering by salesperson_id, agreement_status

- Table: `salesperson_commission_tiers` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for tier_id (TIER-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Machine model-specific commission rates
- Minimum sales value thresholds
- Data expiration: 24 months after created_at
- Partitioning on DATE(created_at) with clustering by agreement_id, machine_model_id

### Personalized Commission Tracking System
- Table: `personalized_commission_tracking` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for tracking_id (TRACK-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Challan number linking for traceability
- Individual commission rate calculation
- Marketing staff incentive tracking
- Payment status management (PENDING, PROCESSING, PAID)
- Data expiration: 24 months after commission_calculated_date
- Partitioning on commission_calculated_date with clustering by challan_number, salesperson_id

### Marketing Staff Incentive System
- Table: `marketing_staff_incentives` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for incentive_id (INCENT-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Activity type validation (VISIT, MEETING, DEMO)
- Incentive type validation (NEW_CUSTOMER, LEAD_QUALITY)
- Verification workflow (PENDING, VERIFIED, REJECTED)
- Data expiration: 24 months after activity_date
- Partitioning on activity_date with clustering by marketing_staff_id, verification_status

### Transportation Cost Tracking System
- Table: `transportation_costs` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for transport_id (TRANSPORT-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Vehicle type validation (VAN, TRUCK, BIKE)
- Customer payment tracking
- Company coverage calculation
- Approval workflow for high-cost transports
- Data expiration: 24 months after created_at
- Partitioning on DATE(created_at) with clustering by challan_number, vehicle_id

### Challan-Commission Integration System
- Table: `challan_commission_integration` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for integration_id (INTEG-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Salesperson-specific commission details
- Marketing staff incentive details
- Transportation cost integration
- Commission due date tracking
- Data expiration: 7 days after last_updated (cache table)
- Partitioning on DATE(last_updated) with clustering by challan_number
- ALL user-facing queries read from this table only
- Automatic cache refresh at 2AM-4AM Bangladesh time

### Quota-Saving Implementation
- NEVER query raw salesperson_commission_agreements or personalized_commission_tracking in user-facing requests
- ALWAYS filter by partitioning column first in all queries
- ALWAYS include at least one clustering column in WHERE clause
- Use approximate functions (APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT) where exact counts aren't needed
- For large aggregations, always use approximate quantiles (APPROX_QUANTILES)
- NEVER use SELECT * - always specify exact columns needed
- ALWAYS use --maximum_bytes_billed flag for all user-facing queries

### Layered Commission Processing
1. Layer 1 (Application Logic):
   - Complete within 50ms
   - Use zero BigQuery quota
   - Validate basic commission structure
   - Return immediate commission estimates
   - Implement the "Don't Type, Tap" philosophy

2. Layer 2 (Contextual Validation):
   - Complete within 100ms
   - Use only Firestore reads (50K free tier daily)
   - Validate against salesperson's specific agreement
   - Check for logical inconsistencies
   - Provide tappable correction options

3. Layer 3 (BQML Anomaly Detection):
   - Complete within 200ms
   - Check cache first (90% hit rate target)
   - Use salesperson-specific BQML models
   - Only query pre-aggregated tables
   - Limit to 100MB data scan per query

4. Layer 4 (Scheduled Reconciliation):
   - Run during off-peak hours (2AM-4AM Bangladesh time)
   - Only process previous day's data
   - Filter by partition column first
   - Use --maximum_bytes_billed=100000000 (100MB) flag
   - Only include high-confidence calculations

### Scheduled Query Requirements
- Daily scheduled query for salesperson_commission_agreements refresh at 02:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for personalized_commission_tracking refresh at 02:30 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for marketing_staff_incentives refresh at 03:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for transportation_costs refresh at 03:30 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for challan_commission_integration refresh at 04:00 Asia/Dhaka
- All scheduled queries have appropriate partition filters
- All scheduled queries have labels for quota monitoring
- All scheduled queries use --maximum_bytes_billed flag

### Data Validation Requirements
- CHECK constraints for all critical fields
- agreement_id must follow exact format: AGREEMENT-YYYYMMDD-ABC
- commission_rate must be between 0-10 (0.0-10.0%)
- transport_id must follow exact format: TRANSPORT-YYYYMMDD-ABC
- company_covered_bdt must equal total_cost_bdt minus customer_payment_bdt
- Implement automatic data quality checks as scheduled queries
- Validate salesperson agreements using recursive SQL

### Data Expiration Policies
- salesperson_commission_agreements: 24 months
- salesperson_commission_tiers: 24 months
- personalized_commission_tracking: 24 months
- marketing_staff_incentives: 24 months
- transportation_costs: 24 months
- challan_commission_integration: 7 days

### Department-Specific Implementation
- SALES: Prioritize individual commission details
- HR: View commission agreements across the organization
- FINANCE: Monitor commission payouts
- Department-specific menu requirements for personalized commission management
- Tappable inline keyboard options instead of requiring typing
- "Don't Type, Tap" philosophy implementation

## Verification
