  - `USER_PERMISSIONS_SCHEMA`
  - `DEPARTMENT_MENUS_SCHEMA`
  - `AUDIT_TRAILS_SCHEMA`
  - `APPROVAL_WORKFLOWS_SCHEMA`
  - `ADMIN_MANAGEMENT_SCHEMA_DESIGN9` (updated for Design 9)

### BigQuery Modules
- `bigquery/quota_saving_design9.js` - Quota-saving implementation with optimized queries for Design 9

### Function Modules
- `functions/user_permissions.js` - User permissions management system
- `functions/department_menus.js` - Department-specific menu system
- `functions/audit_trail.js` - Audit trail system
- `functions/approval_workflow.js` - Approval workflow system
- `functions/department_specific.js` - Department-specific implementation requirements

### Documentation and Verification
- `verify_design9.js` - Verification script to ensure all requirements are met

## Updates to Existing Files

### Admin Management Module
- `functions/admin_management.js` - Updated to include Design 9 role management functionality

### Callbacks Module
- `functions/callbacks.js` - Updated to handle new admin callbacks for role management

## Key Features Implemented

### 7-Tier User Role Hierarchy
1. Admin: Full system access (add/delete/edit all)
2. CEO: Read all, limited edit/delete with audit trail
3. General Manager: Read department + sub-departments, edit/delete within department
4. Department Manager: Read department, edit/delete within department
5. Junior Manager: Read department, edit within 2 days of creation
6. Staff: Read department, add only (edit within 2 hours of creation)
7. ReadOnly: Read only access (external partners, auditors)

### Time-Based Editing Restrictions
- Staff: Edit within 2 hours of creation only
- Junior Manager: Edit within 2 days of creation only
- All others: Edit within 7 days of creation (with audit trail)
- NEVER allows deletion of original records (append-only journal pattern)

### Approval Workflows
- Staff edits after 2 hours require Junior Manager approval
- Junior Manager edits after 2 days require Department Manager approval
- Department Manager edits after 7 days require General Manager approval
- Automatic escalation for pending approvals

### User Permissions Management System
- Table: `user_permissions` with exact schema specifications
- Role-based permissions with time limits
- Approval requirements for edit/delete actions
- Data expiration: 36 months

### Department-Specific Menu System
- Table: `department_menus` with exact schema specifications
- Role-based menu generation
- Time-based action restrictions
- Data expiration: 24 months

### Audit Trail System
- Table: `audit_trails` with exact schema specifications
- Comprehensive audit trail for all record changes
- Approval tracking for time-expired edits
- Data expiration: 36 months

### Approval Workflow System
- Table: `approval_workflows` with exact schema specifications
- Time-based approval thresholds
- Role-based approval chains
- Data expiration: 24 months

### Admin Management System
- Table: `admin_management` updated with Design 9 specifications
- Role and user management functionality
- Audit trail for all admin actions
- Data expiration: 36 months

### Quota-Saving Implementation
- NEVER queries raw user_permissions or department_menus in user-facing requests
- ALWAYS filters by partitioning column first in all queries
- ALWAYS includes at least one clustering column in WHERE clause
- Uses approximate functions (APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT) where exact counts aren't needed
- For large aggregations, always uses approximate quantiles (APPROX_QUANTILES)
- NEVER uses SELECT * - always specifies exact columns needed

### Permission Checking Layers
1. Layer 1 (Role Check): Completes within 5ms, zero BigQuery quota
2. Layer 2 (Time Limit Check): Completes within 10ms, zero BigQuery quota
3. Layer 3 (Approval Workflow Check): Completes within 50ms, uses pre-aggregated tables

### Scheduled Queries
- Daily scheduled query for permission cache refresh at 02:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for approval workflow monitoring at 03:00 Asia/Dhaka
- All scheduled queries have appropriate partition filters
- All scheduled queries have labels for quota monitoring
- All scheduled queries use --maximum_bytes_billed flag

### Department-Specific Requirements
- INVENTORY: Machine stock and service ticket menus
- FINANCE: Payment and expense menus
- SERVICE, SALES, HR, MANAGEMENT: Extensible framework for future implementation

### Data Validation
- CHECK constraints for all critical fields
- Format validation for permission_id, menu_id, audit_id
- Time limit validation for different roles
- Automatic data quality checks as scheduled queries
- Role hierarchy validation using predefined rules

### Data Expiration Policies
- user_permissions: 36 months
- department_menus: 24 months
- audit_trails: 36 months
- approval_workflows: 24 months
- admin_management: 36 months

## Verification
All Design 9 requirements have been verified and implemented successfully. The system is ready for use.
