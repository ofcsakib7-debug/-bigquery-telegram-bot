## Key Features Implemented

### Dealer Hierarchy Management System
- Table: `dealer_profiles` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for dealer_id (DEALER-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Dealer type validation (DEALER, SUB_DEALER)
- Parent-dealer relationship management
- Dealer tier calculation using BQML
- Data expiration: 36 months after opening_date
- Partitioning on opening_date with clustering by dealer_type, status, dealer_tier

### Dealer Credit Management System
- Table: `dealer_credit_terms` with exact schema specifications
- Credit limit and terms management
- Credit risk category calculation using BQML
- Credit score validation (0-100 scale)
- Data expiration: 24 months after last_credit_review
- Partitioning on last_credit_review with clustering by dealer_id, credit_risk_category

### Dual-Layer Stock Transfer System
- Journal Table: `dealer_stock_transfers_journal` (append-only)
- Cache Table: `dealer_stock_transfers_cache` (materialized view)
- ALL user-facing queries read from cache table only
- Automatic cache refresh scheduled at 2AM-4AM Bangladesh time
- Data expiration: 36 months for journal, 7 days for cache
- Partitioning on transfer_date for journal, DATE(last_updated) for cache

### Challan Management System
- Table: `dealer_challan_items` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for challan_item_id (CHALLANITEM-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Final price calculation based on dealer price and discount
- Data expiration: 36 months after created_at
- Partitioning on DATE(created_at) with clustering by challan_number, machine_model_id

### Dealer Payment Management System
- Table: `dealer_payment_journal` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for payment_id (PAY-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Payment for month validation (first day of month)
- Data expiration: 36 months after payment_timestamp
- Partitioning on DATE(payment_timestamp) with clustering by dealer_id, payment_type, payment_method

### Dealer Financial Ledger System
- Table: `dealer_financial_ledger` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for ledger_id (LEDGER-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Double-entry bookkeeping principles
- Data expiration: 36 months after transaction_date
- Partitioning on transaction_date with clustering by dealer_id, transaction_type, voucher_type

### Dealer Performance & Trend Analysis System
- Table: `dealer_performance_metrics` with exact schema specifications
- Format validation for metric_id (METRIC-YYYYMMDD-ABC)
- Performance score validation (0-100 scale)
- Performance category calculation using BQML
- Data expiration: 24 months after metric_date
- Partitioning on metric_date with clustering by dealer_id, performance_category

### BQML Training Data Infrastructure
- Table: `bqml_training_dealer_performance` with exact schema specifications
- Daily data aggregation from dealer_performance_metrics
- Performance trend prediction (IMPROVING, STABLE, DECLINING)
- Data expiration: 90 days after training_date
- Partitioning on training_date with clustering by dealer_id, performance_trend
- Boosted tree classifier for performance trend prediction
- Daily model retraining during off-peak hours

### Quota-Saving Implementation
- NEVER query raw dealer_profiles or dealer_stock_transfers_journal in user-facing requests
- ALWAYS filter by partitioning column first in all queries
- ALWAYS include at least one clustering column in WHERE clause
- Use approximate functions (APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT) where exact counts aren't needed
- For large aggregations, always use approximate quantiles (APPROX_QUANTILES)
- NEVER use SELECT * - always specify exact columns needed
- ALWAYS use --maximum_bytes_billed flag for all user-facing queries

### Layered Validation Rules
1. Layer 1 (Application Logic): Complete within 50ms, zero BigQuery quota
2. Layer 2 (Contextual Validation): Complete within 100ms, Firestore reads only
3. Layer 3 (BQML Anomaly Detection): Complete within 200ms, cached data first
4. Layer 4 (Scheduled Reconciliation): Off-peak hours, previous day's data only

### Scheduled Query Requirements
- Daily scheduled query for dealer_stock_transfers_cache refresh at 02:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for dealer_payment_cache refresh at 02:30 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for dealer_performance_metrics at 03:00 Asia/Dhaka
- Daily scheduled query for dealer_trend_model retraining at 04:00 Asia/Dhaka

### Data Validation Requirements
- CHECK constraints for all critical fields
- Format validation for dealer_id, credit_id, transfer_id, challan_item_id, payment_id, metric_id
- Range validation for credit_score, performance_score
- Automatic data quality checks as scheduled queries
- Dealer hierarchy validation using recursive SQL

### Data Expiration Policies
- dealer_profiles: 36 months
- dealer_credit_terms: 24 months
- dealer_stock_transfers_journal: 36 months
- dealer_stock_transfers_cache: 7 days
- dealer_payment_journal: 36 months
- dealer_payment_cache: 7 days
- dealer_performance_metrics: 24 months
- bqml_training_dealer_performance: 90 days

### Department-Specific Implementation
